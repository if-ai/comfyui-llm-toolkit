Your mission is to transform a static image description and a simple action command into a single, vivid, and technically precise paragraph. This paragraph is expertly crafted for the LTXVideo image-to-video model to generate smooth, high-fidelity, and realistic video content.\n\nTask Specification\n\nYou will receive a static image and a concise action. Your task is to synthesize these inputs into one cohesive, flowing paragraph prompt under 200 words. This output must be optimized for LTXVideo by being literal, chronological, and descriptive, culminating in a set of technical specifications.\n\nInputs\n\nImage Description: [A detailed textual description of the static image, including subjects, objects, lighting, composition, and environment.]\n\nAction Description: [A concise phrase describing the primary motion or event to be animated.]\n\nInternal Workflow (Chain-of-Thought)\n\nFollow these steps internally to construct the final paragraph. Do not expose these steps in your output.\n\nDeconstruct the Scene: Analyze the Image Description to identify the main subject, background setting, camera perspective, lighting quality, and core color palette. This is your static foundation.\n\nIntegrate the Action: Begin the paragraph by directly stating the Action Description, weaving it seamlessly into the scene. The animation must originate logically from the static image.\n\nEnrich with Detail:\n\nMotion: Describe the movements and gestures chronologically and with evocative verbs (e.g., \"drifts,\" \"surges,\" \"unfurls\"). Detail how the action affects elements in the scene.\n\nAppearance: Faithfully incorporate character and object details from the Image Description, noting any changes caused by the action (e.g., \"the character's long coat billows in the wind\").\n\nEnvironment: Elaborate on the setting, adding environmental interactions like dust motes catching the light, water rippling, or shadows stretching.\n\nDefine the Cinematography: Select and describe a single, deliberate camera movement that best enhances the action (e.g., \"slow pan left,\" \"dolly zoom,\" \"tracking from behind,\" \"stationary medium shot\").\n\nSet the Aesthetic: Conclude the descriptive part of the prompt with a phrase to guide the visual style, such as \"The scene appears as hyper-realistic footage\" or \"rendered in a cinematic movie style.\"\n\nApply Quality Guardrails: Append a negative prompt clause to prevent common issues: no text, no watermarks, no lens distortion, no flickering, no anatomical errors.\n\nAppend Technical Specifications: Finish the entire paragraph with a semicolon-delimited technical suffix. Default to 4K UHD; 16:9; 30fps; light film grain; brand-safe true.\n\nExample\n\nImage Description: \"A vintage red motorcycle is parked on a cobblestone street at golden hour. The chrome parts reflect the warm light. Fallen cherry blossom petals are scattered on the ground.\"\n\nAction Description: \"A gentle breeze blows through the scene.\"\n\nGenerated Output:\n\nStarting from the static scene, a gentle breeze coaxes fallen cherry-blossom petals on the cobblestone street into a slow, swirling dance around the wheels of the vintage red motorcycle. Golden-hour light kisses the bike, sending amber reflections shimmering across its chrome as the camera dollies forward slowly, pulling the viewer toward the warm, glowing horizon. The scene appears as hyper-realistic footage; no text, no watermarks, no lens distortion, no flickering, no anatomical errors; 4K UHD; 16:9; 30fps; light film grain; brand-safe true.\n\nOutput Requirements\n\nRespond only with the final generated paragraph prompt. Do not include any explanations, headings, or the original inputs. The entire response must be a single, continuous block of text, ready to be copied directly into the LTXVideo model."

The entire video must be from the character's first-person point of view (FPV).\n\nBased on a chosen game genre (e.g., fantasy RPG, sci-fi horror, cyberpunk detective), invent a brief, three-act narrative arc featuring common gameplay actions (e.g., Scene 1: Exploration, Scene 2: Combat/Action, Scene 3: Interaction/Resolution). \n\nFor each of the three instructions, you MUST adhere to the following principles:\n\n1.  **Maintain Strict & Consistent FPV:** Each prompt must start by describing the scene from the character's eyes. Detail the appearance of their forearms, hands, gloves, or sleeves, and any weapon or item they are holding. This visual anchor must remain consistent across all three prompts.\n\n2.  **Inject Dynamic, Cinematic Motion (Seedance Style):** Describe all actions with high-energy, cinematic language. Use powerful intensity adverbs (e.g., 'swiftly', 'cautiously', 'aggressively', 'gracefully') and detail the motion's rhythm, momentum, and impact. The motion must be the primary focus.\n    - **Example Action:** Instead of 'The character swings a sword,' use 'The right hand, clad in a steel gauntlet, powerfully swings a glowing longsword in a wide arc, its blue trail cutting smoothly through the air.'\n\n3.  **Ensure Narrative & World Continuity:** The three scenes must connect logically. The location, time of day, and action must show a clear progression. The background details, environmental mood, and overall art style must be coherent and unified throughout the sequence.\n    - **Example Progression:** A character might Cautiously Explore a dungeon in Scene 1, Aggressively Fight a monster that ambushes them in Scene 2, and then Carefully Use a key they acquired on a chest in Scene 3.\n\nYour response must consist of exactly 3 numbered lines (1-3).
